## 🔧 Configuration

### Proxy Setup
1. **Configure your proxy tool** (Burp Suite on port 8080)
2. **Set Android proxy settings:**
   - WiFi → Long press → Modify → Advanced → Proxy → Manual
   - Host: Your computer's IP address
   - Port: 8080
3. **Run the Frida script**
4. **Launch Tinder app**
5. **Intercept traffic** in your proxy tool

### Network Security Config
The script automatically bypasses Android's Network Security Configuration:
```xml
<network-security-config>
    <base-config>
        <trust-anchors>
            <certificates src="system" />
            <certificates src="user" />
        </trust-anchors>
    </base-config>
</network-security-config>
```

---

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Custom SSL Pinning Detection
The script automatically detects and bypasses custom SSL pinning implementations:
```javascript
// Automatically hooks methods containing these keywords:
- verify, check, validate, pin, cert, ssl, tls
- Custom Tinder-specific security classes
- Native library security functions
```

### Network Request Monitoring
```javascript
// Logs all network requests for analysis
[*] Network request to: https://api.gotinder.com/v2/auth/login
[*] HTTP connection established to: https://api.gotinder.com/user/matches
[+] Certificate pinning bypassed for: api.gotinder.com
```

### Native Library Hooks
```javascript
// Hooks native SSL functions
[+] SSL_CTX_set_verify bypassed
[+] SSL_set_verify bypassed  
[+] X509_verify_cert bypassed - returning success
[+] Found libFaceMeSDK.so at 0x7f8b2c4000
```

---

## 🔍 How It Works

### 1. SSL Context Bypass
The script creates a custom `TrustManager` that accepts all certificates:
```javascript
var TrustManagerImpl = Java.registerClass({
    name: "com.frida.TrustManagerImpl",
    implements: [X509TrustManager],
    methods: {
        checkServerTrusted: function(chain, authType) {
            // Accept all server certificates
        }
    }
});
```

### 2. Certificate Pinning Bypass
Hooks OkHttp3's `CertificatePinner.check()` method:
```javascript
CertificatePinner.check.implementation = function(hostname, peerCertificates) {
    console.log("[+] Certificate pinning bypassed for: " + hostname);
    return; // Skip certificate validation
};
```

### 3. Proxy Detection Bypass
Intercepts system property requests:
```javascript
System.getProperty.implementation = function(property) {
    if (property === "http.proxyHost" || property === "http.proxyPort") {
        return null; // Hide proxy configuration
    }
    return this.getProperty(property);
};
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**App crashes on startup:**
```bash
# Solution: Try attaching to running app instead
frida -U com.tinder -l tinder_bypass.js
```

**Script not loading:**
```bash
# Check Frida server is running
frida-ps -U

# Verify app package name
frida-ps -Uai | grep tinder
```

**Certificate errors persist:**
```bash
# Try restarting the app with script
# Some custom implementations may require manual hooking
```

**Proxy not intercepting traffic:**
```bash
# Verify proxy settings on device
# Check proxy tool is accepting connections
# Ensure device and proxy are on same network
```

### Debug Commands
```bash
# List running processes
frida-ps -U

# Trace SSL-related function calls
frida-trace -U -f com.tinder -j '*!*ssl*' -j '*!*SSL*'

# Check loaded libraries
frida -U com.tinder -e 'Process.enumerateModules().forEach(function(m) { console.log(m.name); });'
```
